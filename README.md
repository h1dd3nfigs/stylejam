# Stylejam
:warning:  **Under construction! Not ready for public use.**  :construction:

 Generate a styleguide showing mapped colors, color variables and border variables with one command
 - Provide scss variable file along with imported/dependency files
 - No need to change your Sass or add markdown/notation

----

## Who is this for?

A company that wants to audit the colors, fonts and borders that are actually in use and compare them to what was intended for use.  A developer who is less familiar with the sass or css mappings can quickly look something up and move on instead of wasting time searching.
